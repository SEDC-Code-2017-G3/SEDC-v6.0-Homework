        <p>In the heart of New Zealand, you can step into the lush pastures of the Shire, as featured in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies.</p>

        <p>The windows and front door of Bag End were round, a typical feature of hobbit-architecture. Its tunnels and rooms, also typically, were all built on one level. However, only lavish smials like Bag End had many rooms and cellars, with high-quality fixtures, fittings, and furniture. Its front door (on the south) and the porthole-like windows (all on the west) opened onto Bag End's lawns and gardens, the Party Field, and the distant countryside beyond. The main entrance sat on the end of a gated path at the end of a lane leading from the Hill Road.</p>

        <p>Hobbiton was a village on a stream locally known as The Water, a short distance west of Bywater. It had a mill, and there was a small inn called the Ivy Bush at the eastern end of the village, on the road to Bywater. The part of the village on the north of the river was known as Hobbiton-across-the-Water. This included The Hill, with Bag End and the neighbourhood of Underhill on the south, and Overhill on the north of the Hill. The Hill Road led north from Hobbiton past Bagshot Row and The Hill and on to Overhill.</p>
        <h1>Travel to Narnia</h1>
        <p>Narnia is a faraway land located in the depths of your wardrobe. The catch to getting into Narnia is that one can not intend to go to Narnia. While this present difficulties, it also means there are a great number of possibilities for entering the country. Hiding in a wardrobe, being summoned by a magic horn, gazing at unusual paintings, and catching the wind after leaping from high cliffs have all been reported as entry methods, but since these have been done before you will likely need to find a new method for yourself. A good rule of thumb is that if you walk into bedroom furniture and find yourself in a forest, or if your picture of a boat begins leaking and eventually floods your room, you may be on the verge of a Narnian holiday.</p>

        <p>The country of Narnia is where most of the action of the series is set. According to the mythology of the series, Narnia was created by the great lion, Aslan, and is filled with talking animals and mythical creatures. C. S. Lewis may have taken the name from the Italian town of Narni, whose Latin name was in fact Narnia. Narnia features rolling hills rising into low mountains to the south, and is predominantly forested except for marshlands in the north. The region is bordered on the east by the Eastern Ocean, on the west by a great mountain range, on the north by the River Shribble, and on the south by Archenland.</p>
