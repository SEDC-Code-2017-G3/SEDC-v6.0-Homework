                    <p>"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of
                        worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to
                        eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."</p>
                    <img src="../images/hobbit.jpg" alt="The Hobbit">
                    <p>Tolkien, a professor at Oxford University at the time he began writing the book, said that it began from
                        a single senseless sentence ("In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit") scrawled on an exam
                        paper he was grading. When he began, he did not intend to connect the story with the much more profound
                        mythology he was working on.</p>
                    <p>However as Tolkien continued writing it, he decided that the events of
                        <i>The Hobbit</i> could belong to the same universe as
                        <i>The Silmarillion</i>, and he introduced or mentioned characters and places that figured prominently
                        in Tolkien's legendarium, specifically Elrond, Gil-galad and Gondolin. Taken into consideration with
                        the rest of Tolkien's work,
                        <i>The Hobbit</i> serves as both an introduction to Middle-earth as well as a narrative link between
                        earlier and later events as told in
                        <i>The Silmarillion</i> and
                        <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, respectively.</p>
                    <p>It has been suggested that
                        <i>The Hobbit</i> can be read as a bildungsroman in which Bilbo matures from an initially insular, superficial,
                        and rather useless person to one who is versatile, brave, self-sufficient, and relied-upon by others
                        when they are in need of assistance. However Tolkien himself probably did not intend the book to
                        be read in this way. In the foreword to
                        <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> he writes, "I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and
                        always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence." He claims that
                        <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is "neither allegorical nor topical". It seems safe to assume that
                        <i>The Hobbit</i> was written with the same caveats. The judgement of Bilbo as "superficial" and "useless"
                        seems harsh since he was, according to Tolkien, rather typical of hobbits in general.</p>

                    <p>J.R.R. Tolkien's
                        <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy is a genuine masterpiece. The most widely read and influential
                        fantasy epic of all time, it is also quite simply one of the most memorable and beloved tales ever
                        told.</p>
                    <img id="lotr_pic" src="../images/lotr.png" alt="The Lord of the Rings">
                    <p>Originally published in 1954,
                        <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> set the framework upon which all epic/quest fantasy since has been built.
                        Through the urgings of the enigmatic wizard Gandalf, young hobbit Frodo Baggins embarks on an urgent,
                        incredibly treacherous journey to destroy the One Ring. This ring - created and then lost by the
                        Dark Lord, Sauron, centuries earlier - is a weapon of evil, one that Sauron desperately wants returned
                        to him. With the power of the ring once again his own, the Dark Lord will unleash his wrath upon
                        all of Middle-earth. The only way to prevent this horrible fate from becoming reality is to return
                        the Ring to Mordor, the only place it can be destroyed. Unfortunately for our heroes, Mordor is also
                        Sauron's lair.
                        <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy is essential reading not only for fans of fantasy but for lovers
                        of classic literature as well. Some like to play games, for example visit here, before reading the
                        books out loud... you should maybe try that one day?</p>
                    <p>The story concerns peoples such as Hobbits, Elves, Men, Dwarves, Wizards, and Orcs (called goblins in
                        <i>The Hobbit</i>), and centers on the Ring of Power made by the Dark Lord Sauron. Starting from quiet
                        beginnings in The Shire, the story ranges across Middle-earth and follows the courses of the War
                        of the Ring. The main story is followed by six appendices that provide a wealth of historical and
                        linguistic background material, as well as an index listing every character, place, song, and sword.

                    <p>
                        <i>The Silmarillion</i> is actually Tolkien's first book and also his last. In origin it precedes even
                        <i>The Hobbit</i>, and is the story of the First Age of Tolkien's Middle Earth. It shows us the ancient
                        history to which characters in
                        <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> look back, talk, rhyme and sing about. Tolkien worked on it, changed it,
                        and enlarged it throughout his entire life. It was edited and published posthumously by his son Christopher
                        Tolkien, with the assistance of fantasy fiction writer Guy Gavriel Kay to reconstruct some major
                        parts.</p>
                    <img src="../images/silmarillion.jpg" alt="The Silmarillion">
                    <p>A complete summary is impossible, because the book spans millennia and has one earth-shattering event
                        after another. But it includes the creation of Tolkien's invented pantheons of angelic beings under
                        Eru Iluvatar, also known as God; how they sang the world into being; the creation of Elves, Men,
                        and Dwarves; the legendary love story of Beren and Luthien, a mortal Man and an Elf maiden who gives
                        up her immortality for the man she loves; the demonic Morgoth and Sauron; Elves of just about any
                        kind - bad, mad, dangerous, good, sweet, brave, and so forth; the creation of the many Rings of Power
                        - and the One Ring of Sauron; the Two Trees that made the sun and moon; and finally the quest of
                        the Ringbearer, Frodo Baggins.</p>
                    <p>The writing style of
                        <i>The Silmarillion</i> is more akin to the Eddas, the Bible, or the Mabinogian than to
                        <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. It's more formal and archaic in tone; Tolkien did not get as "into" the
                        heads of his characters in
                        <i>The Silmarillion</i> as he did in LOTR, and there is no central character. Needless to say, this
                        is necessary as a more in-depth approach would have taken centuries to write, let alone perfect.
                        If readers can bypass the automatic dislike of more formal prose, they will find enchanting stories
                        and a less evocative but very intriguing writing style. This style strongly leans on the Eddas, collections
                        of story and song that were unearthed and translated long ago. Though obviously not as well-known
                        as LOTR, it is clear that these collections helped influence the
                        <i>The Silmarillion</i>.</p>

                    <p>
                        <i>Unfinished Tales</i>, as the title aptly suggests, is a collection of Tolkien's 'expanded' Middle
                        Earth stories (mostly longer versions of tales from
                        <i>The Silmarillion</i>, but there are plenty of revealing
                        <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> moments featuring old faves Gandalf, Elrond, The Nazgul, Balrogs et al)
                        edited into a single volume by the authors son, Christopher Tolkien.</p>
                    <img src="../images/unfinishedtales.jpg" alt="Unfinished Tales">
                    <p>Unlike
                        <i>The Silmarillion</i> (which is universally recognised as a vital part of Tolkien's literary masterwork,
                        but takes some effort to wade through the complexities of names, places, ages and references included
                        in the earlier volume),
                        <i>Unfinished Tales</i> is suprisingly straightforward, by comparison; The style of writing is, for
                        the most part, comparable to the tone of
                        <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, including many (not to be missed) moments of classic Tolkien humour, some
                        bitter-sweet obervations on the human condition with regard to affairs of the heart and the spirit,
                        and last but not least - lashings of swashbuckling adventure.</p>
                    <p>J.R.R. Tolkien's tales of Middle-Earth weren't restricted just to fantasy epic
                        <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. His life's work was spread over hundreds of stories and invented legends
                        - some were compiled into
                        <i>The Silmarillion</i>. But some were left over - yes, there were even more stories that didn't make
                        the cut. These little odd bits make up
                        <i>Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-Earth</i>. The stories are not as interconnected as
                        <i>The Silmarillion</i> was, but they are a solid and enjoyable read.</p>
